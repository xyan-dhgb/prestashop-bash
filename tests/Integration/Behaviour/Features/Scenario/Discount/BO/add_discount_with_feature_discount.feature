  PrestaShop allows BO users to update discounts conditions
  As a BO user
  I must be able to create discounts

  Scenario: Create discount with feature trigger
    When I create product feature "element" with specified properties:
      | name[en-US]      | Nature Element |
      | associated shops | shop1          |
    Then product feature "element" should have following details:

    When I create a "free_shipping" discount "discount_with_feature_trigger" with following properties:

    Then discount "discount_with_feature_trigger" should have the following properties:
      | name[en-US] | Promotion     |

    When I update discount "discount_with_feature_trigger" with following conditions matching at least 42 products:
      | condition_type | items |
      | features        | fire  |
