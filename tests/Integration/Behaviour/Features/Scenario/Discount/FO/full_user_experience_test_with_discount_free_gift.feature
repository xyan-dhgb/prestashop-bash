Feature: Full UX discount test
  PrestaShop allows BO users to create discounts
  As a BO user
  I must be able to create discounts using the new discounts

    Given there is a customer named "testCustomer" whose email is "pub@prestashop.com"
    Given there is a customer named "testCustomer2" whose email is "pub2@prestashop.com"

    And language "french" with locale "fr-FR" exists
    Given shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    And there is a currency named "usd" with iso code "USD" and exchange rate of 0.92

  Scenario: Create a complete discount with free gift using new CQRS
    Given I create an empty cart "dummy_cart" for customer "testCustomer"
    Given there is a product "hummingbird-tshirt-simple" with name "Hummingbird printed t-shirt"
