Feature: Full UX discount test
  PrestaShop allows BO users to create discounts
  As a BO user
  I must be able to create discounts using the new discounts

  Background:
    Given there is a customer named "testCustomer" whose email is "pub@prestashop.com"
    Given there is a customer named "testCustomer2" whose email is "pub2@prestashop.com"
    Given language with iso code "en" is the default one
    And language "french" with locale "fr-FR" exists
    Given shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    And there is a currency named "usd" with iso code "USD" and exchange rate of 0.92

  Scenario: Create a complete product level percent discount using new CQRS
    Given I create an empty cart "dummy_cart" for customer "testCustomer"
    And there is a product in the catalog named "product1" with a price of 19.812 and 1000 items in stock
    And there is a product in the catalog named "product2" with a price of 20.0 and 1000 items in stock
    When I create a "product_level" discount "complete_percent_product_level_discount" with following properties:
      | name[en-US]       | Promotion           |
      | name[fr-FR]       | Promotion_fr        |
      | active            | true                |
      | valid_from        | 2025-01-01 11:05:00 |
      | valid_to          | 2025-12-01 00:00:00 |
      | code              | PROMO_CART_2025_2   |
      | reduction_percent | 50.0                |
      | reduction_product | -1                  |
    And discount "complete_percent_product_level_discount" should have the following properties:
      | name[en-US]       | Promotion           |
      | name[fr-FR]       | Promotion_fr        |
      | active            | true                |
      | valid_from        | 2025-01-01 11:05:00 |
      | valid_to          | 2025-12-01 00:00:00 |
      | code              | PROMO_CART_2025_2   |
      | reduction_percent | 50.0                |
      | reduction_product | -1                  |
    And I add 1 product "product1" to the cart "dummy_cart"
    And I add 1 product "product2" to the cart "dummy_cart"
    And cart "dummy_cart" total with tax included should be '$46.81'
    And I use a voucher "complete_percent_product_level_discount" on the cart "dummy_cart"
    And cart "dummy_cart" total with tax included should be '$36.90'
    Then my cart "dummy_cart" should have the following details:
      | total_products | $39.81 |
      | total_discount | -$9.91 |
      | shipping       | $7.00  |
      | total          | $36.90 |

  Scenario: Create a complete product level percent discount using new CQRS
    Given I create an empty cart "dummy_cart_2" for customer "testCustomer2"
    And there is a product in the catalog named "product3" with a price of 19.9 and 1000 items in stock
    When I create a "product_level" discount "complete_percent_product_level_discount" with following properties:

      | reduction_percent | 50.0                |
      | reduction_product | product3            |
    And discount "complete_percent_product_level_discount" should have the following properties:
      | name[en-US]       | Promotion2          |
      | name[fr-FR]       | Promotion_2_fr      |

    And I use a voucher "complete_percent_product_level_discount" on the cart "dummy_cart_2"
    And cart "dummy_cart_2" total with tax included should be '$16.95'
    Then my cart "dummy_cart_2" should have the following details:

      | total_discount | -$9.95 |
      | shipping       | $7.00  |
