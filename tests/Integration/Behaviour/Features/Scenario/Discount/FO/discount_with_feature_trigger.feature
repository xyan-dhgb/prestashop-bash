Feature: Add discount with feature trigger on FO
  PrestaShop allows discounts with feature trigger as the condition

  Background:
    Given there is a customer named "testCustomer" whose email is "pub@prestashop.com"
    Given language with iso code "en" is the default one
    And language "french" with locale "fr-FR" exists
    Given shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    And there is a currency named "usd" with iso code "USD" and exchange rate of 0.92
    And shop configuration for "PS_CART_RULE_FEATURE_ACTIVE" is set to 1

    When I create product feature "element" with specified properties:
      | name[en-US]      | Nature Element |
      | associated shops | shop1          |
    Then product feature "element" should have following details:
      | name[en-US] | Nature Element |

    When I create feature value "fire" for feature "element" with following properties:
      | value[en-US] | Fire |
      | value[fr-FR] | Feu  |
    Given I add product "fireMagicBook" with following information:
      | name[en-US] | Fire Magic Book |
      | type        | standard        |
    Then product "fireMagicBook" should have no feature values
    When I set to product "fireMagicBook" the following feature values:
      | feature | feature_value |
      | element | fire          |
    Then product "fireMagicBook" should have following feature values:
      | feature | feature_value |
      | element | fire          |
    And I update product "fireMagicBook" stock with following information:

      | name[en-US]        | Promotion                  |
      | name[fr-FR]        | Promotion                  |

      | taxIncluded        | true                       |

      | taxIncluded        | true                       |
