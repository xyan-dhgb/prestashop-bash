Feature: Full UX discount test
  PrestaShop allows BO users to create discounts
  As a BO user
  I must be able to create discounts using the new discounts

  Background:
    Given there is a customer named "testCustomer" whose email is "pub@prestashop.com"
    Given there is a customer named "testCustomer2" whose email is "pub2@prestashop.com"
    Given language with iso code "en" is the default one
    And language "french" with locale "fr-FR" exists
    Given shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    And there is a currency named "usd" with iso code "USD" and exchange rate of 0.92
    And shop configuration for "PS_order_RULE_FEATURE_ACTIVE" is set to 1

  Scenario: Create a complete order level flat discount using new CQRS
    Given I create an empty cart "dummy_cart" for customer "testCustomer"
    And I enable feature flag "discount"
    And there is a product in the catalog named "product1" with a price of 19.812 and 1000 items in stock
    And there is a product in the catalog named "product2" with a price of 20.0 and 1000 items in stock
    When I create a "order_level" discount "complete_amount_order_level_discount" with following properties:

    And cart "dummy_cart" total with tax included should be '$46.81'
    And I use a voucher "complete_amount_order_level_discount" on the cart "dummy_cart"
    And cart "dummy_cart" total with tax included should be '$36.81'
