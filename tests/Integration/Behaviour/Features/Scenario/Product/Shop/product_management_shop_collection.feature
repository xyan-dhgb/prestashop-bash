Feature: Edit product with specific list of shops.
  As a BO user I want to be able to edit a product for specific shops.

  Background:
    Given I enable multishop feature
    And language with iso code "en" is the default one
    And language "english" with locale "en-US" exists
    And language "french" with locale "fr-FR" exists
    And attribute group "Size" named "Size" in en language exists
    And attribute group "Color" named "Color" in en language exists
    And attribute "S" named "S" in en language exists
    And attribute "M" named "M" in en language exists
    And attribute "L" named "L" in en language exists
    And attribute "White" named "White" in en language exists
    And attribute "Black" named "Black" in en language exists
    And attribute "Blue" named "Blue" in en language exists
    And manufacturer studioDesign named "Studio Design" exists
    And manufacturer graphicCorner named "Graphic Corner" exists
    And following image types should be applicable to products:
      | reference     | name           | width | height |
      | cartDefault   | cart_default   | 125   | 125    |
      | homeDefault   | home_default   | 250   | 250    |
      | largeDefault  | large_default  | 800   | 800    |
      | mediumDefault | medium_default | 452   | 452    |
      | smallDefault  | small_default  | 98    | 98     |
    And shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    And shop group "default_shop_group" with name "Default" exists
    And I add a shop "shop2" with name "test_second_shop" and color "red" for the group "default_shop_group"
    And I add a shop group "test_second_shop_group" with name "Test second shop group" and color "green"
    And I add a shop "shop3" with name "test_third_shop" and color "blue" for the group "test_second_shop_group"
    And I add a shop "shop4" with name "test_shop_without_url" and color "blue" for the group "test_second_shop_group"
    And single shop context is loaded
    And language "french" with locale "fr-FR" exists
    And I add product "product" to shop "shop1" with following information:
      | name[en-US] | magic staff |
      | type        | standard    |
    And default shop for product product is shop1
    And I set following shops for product "product":
      | source shop | shop1                   |
      | shops       | shop1,shop2,shop3,shop4 |
    Then product product is associated to shops "shop1,shop2,shop3,shop4"
    And product "product" should have no images
