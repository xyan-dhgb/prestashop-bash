Feature: Carrier available
  As a BO user i want to recover the common carriers of different products, as well as those filtered

  Background:
    Given shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    And I set up shop context to single shop shop1
    And language "fr" with locale "fr-FR" exists
    And language "en" with locale "en-US" exists
    And language with iso code "en" is the default one
    And I add new zone "zone1" with following properties:
      | name    | zone1  |
      | enabled | true   |
    And there is a country named "country1" and iso code "FR" in zone "zone1"
    And there is a state named "state1" with iso code "TEST-1" in country "country1" and zone "zone1"
    And there is an address named "address1" with postcode "1" in state "state1"
